# Inst126-Card-Memory

Consolidation project. I will be making a Card Memory Game. My code will first ask how many players there are. Then you will be asked how many turns you would like to play. Then the game starts with player 1 and starts listing the cards in 1.5 second intervals. After listing the cards, it will randomly choose for the player to recall the suits(Clubs, Spades,Hearts,Diamonds) or Rank(2-10, Jack, QUeen ,King ,Ace) The player is then to enter the inforomation so thay it matches the cards that were dealt. If the player gets it right they will get one point. If they get it right with capitalization they will get an additional 1 point for a total of 2 points. Then it will show the updated score before moving on to player 2's turn. This process continues untill the turns(depends on how many the players entered) are up. The code then says game over and calculates the winner by seeing who has the higher score and saying who the winner is. Have fun!
