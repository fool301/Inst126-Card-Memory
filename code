### Will make the card game as described with the winner being the player with the most points 
### after a certain amount of turns
## turns will be inputed by the players that way they can decide how long they want to play
### I will also add a feature where if a player gets the info correct with capitalization they get an aditional point
### i think this will make it more interesting because if someone forgets to capitalize they wont get the extra point
